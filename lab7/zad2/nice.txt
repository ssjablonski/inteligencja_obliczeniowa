Everything was perfect, the equipment, the cleanliness, the location and the communication with the owner (very responsive). We enjoyed the calm and proximity of the beach. We were able to check out early without problem. We will keep an excellent memory of our stay. The owner does everything to make his guests feel good and the welcome with the cake is really comforting. Thanks again!
