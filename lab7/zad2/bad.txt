My stay at the Dismal Hotel was a nightmare. The room was filthy, with a damp, stained carpet and moldy smell. The bed was uncomfortable, with dirty sheets and hair everywhere. The bathroom was disgusting, with cracked tiles and insects crawling around. The food was even worse. The meals were barely edible, cold, and tasted awful. The dining area was dirty, and the staff seemed indifferent to the guests. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Avoid at all costs!
